# 🐍 Python Projects Portfolio (88 Projects Completed) 🎉

Welcome to my personal Python Projects Repository!  
Over the past few months, I have completed **88 hands-on projects** using Python — ranging from beginner-friendly mini apps to API integrations and GUI games.

## 📌 About This Repository

This collection showcases my learning journey with Python, covering key concepts such as:

- 🔁 Loops, Conditions, Functions
- 📦 Working with APIs
- 🧠 Logic building
- 🖼 GUI with Tkinter & Streamlit
- 🎮 Game development with Pygame
- 📊 Data handling and JSON
- 🤖 Discord bots
- 🔐 Encryption, Authentication, Web scraping

Each project is stored in its own folder with clear code and (in most cases) a `README.md` for explanation.
